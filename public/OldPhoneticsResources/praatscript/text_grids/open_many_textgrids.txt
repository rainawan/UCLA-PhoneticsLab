#The filter could be just a simple if-then-construction: if a filename 
#fulfils a criterion, then read the file, otherwise move on to the next 
#filename. Here's an example that will only select filenames ending with 
#exactly the string ".TextGrid". Just add the if...-line to the script 
#(because the corresponding endif-line was in the previous script by 
#mistake). You can make different versions of the script to open 
#different file types. See the Praat manual on how to use more complex 
#criteria for string variables.

#Read from file... 'directory$''filename$'
# by the way, if you have no filename filter (starting with if),
# the next endif line is not necessary at all... sorry!
